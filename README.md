## Introduction
I needed a simple way to allow users to upload a webcam selfie but was unable to find any straight forward or free option. There are a ton of paid to verify services but I don't need quite that level of security so have been working on this simple PHP, HTML and JS "web app" to upload/send a selfie. 

## Key Features
- **Simplicity**: A straightforward, plug-and-play solution for adding selfie functionality to any website.
- **Versatility**: Ideal for identity verification, social interactions, or any application requiring user photos.
- **Real-Time Capture and Upload**: Users can take selfies using their webcam and upload them instantly.
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully responsive design ensures functionality across all devices and browsers.
- **Open-Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute, making it an ideal component for developers and businesses alike.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 for layout and styling, JavaScript for webcam access and image capture.
- **Backend**: PHP for handling image uploads and server-side processing.
- **Storage**: Images can be saved on the server or processed according to application needs.

## Getting Started
Incorporate the Webcam Selfie Upload Module into your project with these easy steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/webcam-selfie-upload.git

2. **Integration**
   Place the module in your project's web directory. Include the module's frontend components in your HTML.

3. **Configuration**

4. **Launch**
   Integrate the module with your application's frontend where you need the selfie upload functionality.

## Usage Scenarios
- **Identity Verification**: Streamline user onboarding for financial services, social platforms, and age-restricted content.

- **Customer Feedback**: Enable a more personalized feedback mechanism for services and products.
