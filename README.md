## What's This All About?
A quick and easy, barebones web app for users to upload a webcam selfie to a website. As more and more sites need to verify a users identity and Snap a selfie, share it instantly, and let the conversations roll! It's all about making those chats lively and bringing everyone closer, one selfie at a time.

## Cool Features
- **Chat in Real-Time:** Messages fly back and forth without delay. It's like having a conversation in person but, you know, online.
- **Selfie Magic:** A button away from sharing what you're up to. No need to switch apps to share a selfie.
- **Style That Text:** Add a bit of flair to your messages. Bold, italic, you name it.
- **Easy Access:** Forget sign-ups or log-ins. Dive right into chatting.
- **Everywhere You Go:** Works on any device with a browser. Keeping up with friends and family made easy.

## Tech Talk
We're all about keeping it simple:
- **Frontend**: A sprinkle of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Data Storage**: Everything's neatly tucked into a `.txt` file. Easy peasy.
